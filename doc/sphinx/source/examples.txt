This section gives an overwiew of what we can do with PySpice. These examples are inspired from
classical circuits and can serve as learning material.

Usually these examples don't involve advanced Python programming. You just need to know basic Python
programming and how to use the Numpy and Matplotlib framework. However the code to make complexe
figures can require advanced Matplotlib topics.

 How to Run theses Examples
----------------------------

A Linux desktop is the best platform to work with PySpice. Indeed it is easier to get NgSpice
running and install Python.

There is several ways to run the examples: as a script from the console, in the Ipython interactive
environment or in a web browser using the Ipython Notebook. Each has their advantages and drawbacks.
A script is best when we want to work on a file using an editor. And an interactive environment is
best when we want to play with code in live.

To run an example from the console, execute this command:

.. code-block:: sh

  python examples/.../foo.py

To start the interactive IPython environment:

.. code-block:: sh

  ipython --matplotlib       # enable matplotlib integration
  ipython --matplotlib-qt    # enable matplotlib integration with qt4 backend
  ipython qtconsole          # start the qtconsole GUI application

then run an example using the magic command:

.. code-block:: py

 %run examples/../foo.py

To start the IPython notebook in your web browser:

.. code-block:: sh

  ipython notebook 

When we use IPython notebook it is convenient to use a matplotlib backend that outputs the graphics
embedded in the notebook file. To activate this backend, somewhere in the beginning on the notebook,
you must add:

.. code-block:: py

  %matplotlib inline

Then you can copy-paste code blocks and execute them.

.. warning::

  Notice for security reason, web browsers don't offer a simple way to copy-paste a code block
  (i.e. fill the clipboard using a button and some javascript behind the scene). You must select and
  copy by hand the code.
